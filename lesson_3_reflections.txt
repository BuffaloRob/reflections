1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I'd say just about any time that opsec wasn't a concern or having an internet connection would be an issue.  
  With a remote repository you can access your work from anywhere there is an internet connction

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git Automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If you are working on a project with someone else, or multiple people, this could get confusing and overwhelming with the amount of pulls.

3) Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?
	I understand this concept pretty well so I'm gonna skip this one

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	I'm not really sure, I need to look this one up...
	Borrowed ffom the instructor:
	 If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
