1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It starts a new repository, this needs to be done because it's the first logical step. With out it there would be no place to save future commits

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is self-explanitory, it stages changes ready to be commited. Not sure really why you wouldn't just make a commit.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Run the git diff command to see the difference between what you have staged and the original, does the change shown constitute a logical change?

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Anything expiramental comes to mind first, but I could also see branches being useful for things like customizing something for a particular clients needs. Branches would help by allowing you to use all the work put into the master to customize it for a particular application while at the same time not changing the master so that it would still be adaptable for other customers.
